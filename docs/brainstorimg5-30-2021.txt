The orginal question, how can cryptocurrency improve the economic situation of
marginalized communiites, is difficult because blockchain ledgers do not contain
demographic or geographic information.

 
We can grab data from digital platforms like Coinbase or Robinhood to get more detailed
user data. 
	--> TODO: research platforms that might contain user information related to 
		cryptocurrenies 

 
We can cross-reference data from traditional financial institutions. Such information
may include overdraft fees, volume of transcations, etc. We are not necessarily 
limited to blockchian ledgers.

Tenative Question: 
Can Adoption of Digital Currency Alleviate Predatory Payday Loans That Are 
Rampant in Marginalized Communities?

Formulate questions for stakeholders and technical contacts.
